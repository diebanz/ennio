					<h2 class="heading heading_2">About Ennio Morricone</h2>
					<p>
						Morricone was born in Rome, the son of Libera Ridolfi
						and Mario Morricone, a musician. At the time of his
						birth Italy was under fascist rule. His family came from
						Arpino, near Frosinone. Morricone had four siblings —
						Adriana, Aldo,Maria, and Franca — and lived in
						Trastevere in the centre of Rome. His father was a
						professional trumpet player who performed in light-music
						orchestras while his mother set up a small textile
						business.
					</p>
					<p>
						Morricone's father first taught him to read music and to
						play several instruments. He entered the Saint Cecilia
						Conservatory to take trumpet lessons under the guidance
						of Umberto Semproni. He formally entered the
						conservatory in 1940 at age 12, enrolling in a four-year
						harmony program that he completed within six months. He
						studied the trumpet, composition, and choral music under
						the direction of Goffredo Petrassi, to whom Morricone
						would later dedicate concert pieces.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 1941 Morricone was chosen among the students of the
						Saint Cecilia Conservatory to be a part of the Orchestra
						of the Opera, directed by Carlo Zecchi on the occasion
						of a tour of the Veneto region.He received his diploma
						in trumpet in 1946,continuing to work in classical
						composition and arrangement.Morricone received the
						Diploma in Instrumentation for Band Arrangement with a
						mark of 9/10 in 1952. His studies concluded at the
						Conservatory of Santa Cecilia in 1954 when he obtained a
						final 9.5/10 in his Diploma in Composition under
						Petrassi.

						<h3 class="heading heading_3">Comedy</h3>
						<p>
							Morricone's earliest scores were Italian light
							comedy and costume pictures, where he learned to
							write simple, memorable themes. During the nineteen
							sixties and seventies he composed the scores for
							comedies such as Eighteen in the Sun (Diciottenni al
							sole, 1962), Il Successo (1963), Lina Wertmüller's I
							basilischi (The Basilisks/The Lizards, 1963), Slalom
							(1965), Menage all'italiana (Menage Italian Style,
							1965), How I Learned to Love Women (Come imparai ad
							amare le donne, 1966), Her Harem (L'harem, 1967), A
							Fine Pair (Ruba al prossimo tuo, 1968), L'Alibi
							(1969), This Kind of Love (Questa specie d'amore,
							1972), Winged Devils (Forza "G", 1972), and Fiorina
							la vacca (1972).
						</p>
						<p>
							His best-known scores for comedies includes La Cage
							aux Folles (1978) and La Cage aux Folles II (1980),
							both directed by Édouard Molinaro, Il ladrone (The
							Good Thief, 1980), Georges Lautner's La Cage aux
							Folles 3: The Wedding (1985), Pedro Almodóvar's Tie
							Me Up! Tie Me Down! (1990) and Warren Beatty's
							Bulworth (1998). Morricone never ceased to arrange
							and write music for comedies. In 2007, he composed a
							lighthearted score for the Italian romantic comedy
							Tutte le Donne della mia Vita by Simona Izzo, the
							director who co-wrote the Morricone-scored religious
							mini-series Il Papa Buono

							Although his first films were
							undistinguished,[clarification needed] Morricone's
							arrangement of an American folk song intrigued
							director and former schoolmate Sergio Leone. Before
							being associated with Leone, Morricone already had
							composed some music for less-known western movies
							such as Duello nel Texas (aka Gunfight at Red Sands)
							(1963). In 1962, Morricone met American folksinger
							Peter Tevis, with the two collaborating on a version
							of Woody Guthrie's Pastures of Plenty. Tevis is
							credited with singing the lyrics of Morricone's
							songs such as "A Gringo Like Me" (from Gunfight at
							Red Sands) and "Lonesome Billy" (from Bullets Don't
							Argue).[48] Tevis later recorded a vocal version of
							A Fistful of Dollars that was not used in the film.
